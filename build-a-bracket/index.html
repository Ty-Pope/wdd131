  <h2>What is a single elimination bracket?</h2>
  <div class="colored">
   <img src="assets/single-elim.png" alt="">
   <p>A single-elimination, knockout, or sudden death tournament is a type of
    elimination tournament where the loser of each match-up is immediately
    eliminated from the tournament. The losing team or player is eliminated from the competition, while the winner
    advances to the next round. This process continues until only one team or player remains, who is declared the
    champion.</p>
